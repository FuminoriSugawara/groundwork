GroundworkCSS Stand-Alone Grid System
=====================================

Say hello to the last grid system you'll ever need.

The GroundworkCSS Grid System is:

* fluid
* nestable
* responsive
* based on simple fractions
* range of fractions can easily be changed/optimized
* works on virtually anything: mobile, tablet, or large screen devices
* supports purely semantic implementations by utilizing Sass @extend, @mixin and 
  %placeholder classes
